# Telescopic-Postprocessing
This demo uses the post processing effect named Alexander Snapp stack in order to create a unfocused telescope effect which incorporates depth based blur which increases towards the center of objects and has a mildly blurred outline along the edges of objects in the frame. It also incorporates a 'circular view point' meant to simulate the effect of looking through a telescope. It also uses the position of pixels in the screen to give the telescope a slight focus increase towards the circular view point center which is used alongside the depth based blur and the outliner.

If you would like to download the package for use in your own code, please download Alexander_Snapp.unitypackage , if you would like to just view the code from within github, please look at the folder named
