# Telescopic-Postprocessing
This demo uses the post processing effect named Alexander Snapp stack in order to create a unfocused telescope effect which incorporates depth based blur which increases towards the center of objects and has a mildly blurred outline along the edges of objects in the frame. It also incorporates a 'circular view point' meant to simulate the effect of looking through a telescope. It also uses the position of pixels in the screen to give the telescope a slight focus increase towards the circular view point center which is used alongside the depth based blur and the outliner.
